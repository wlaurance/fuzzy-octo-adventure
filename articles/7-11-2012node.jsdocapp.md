{"title":"Node.js doc app","date":"7-11-2012","author":"wlaurance"}

I am currently working on a node.js documentation app similiar to
andnodejs. I really like andnodejs but the versions of node are not
being updated with the app. But I figured why not just let the user
choose which versions of node they would like to have installed.
[Nodoroid](https://github.com/wlaurance/nodoroid) solves this problem by
allowing the user to choose which version of the node documentaion they
have. It also supports having as many versions as you would like. The
view of docs will be in a similar manner to andnodejs. 

In the spirit of node, this app is written in javascript using
Appcelerator's titanium studio. I have used this framework for numerous
apps on iOS but never for android. The only downsides are the size of
the apk, and the boot time. It takes a few extra seconds for the V8
runtime to load. Other than this, the app preformance on par with a
traditional android app.

For the first release of the app I plan to have the node.js doc portion
supported, with another tab for future NPM package search and stats. In the first
release the NPM tab will have a feedback form so users can tell me
exactly what they want from the NPM side of this app. I will be using
[appygram](http://www.appygram.com) for feedback handling. Plan to see
the first release of the app by late August 2012.
