{"title":"Funny Things PPL Say At Networking Events","date":"11-10-2012"}

So I have been attending more conferences and networking events. I find
people say funny things and sometimes they have no idea what they are
talking about.

## WM Comp Sci Night 2012

### Guy1
Me: So are you using git?

Him: No, then I would have to make my project open source.

### Guy2
Me: So are you using git?

Him: No, I'm afraid of git. Nor do I trust our IT guy to install it.

### Guy1
Him: Yeah we have just launch our mobile app.

Me: So do you have a REST api the app uses to access your data etc?

Him: Yeah we use REST, but not with the verbs.
