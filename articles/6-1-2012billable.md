{"title":"Billable","date":"6-1-2012"}

As a freelance software developer I often find myself asking whether
what I am doing at the moment is worth my time. Am I getting paid to do
this specific task? Is my solution *good enough*? I use
[Freshbooks](http://www.freshbooks.com) for invoicing clients and
tracking my time on projects. Although it feels like I have worked close
to 40 hours, my *Billable* time is not quite hitting the mark. Perhaps
this is due to missing certain tasks in my time logs. Starting a new
task without punching the clock. For whatever reason my time log
sometimes does not reflect my time spent working.

Its time to venture into new territory. Ideally I want to track my time
with git. I have read a
[few](http://andy.delcambre.com/2008/02/06/git-time-tracking.html)
[blog](http://mir.aculo.us/2009/10/12/instant-time-tracking-from-git-commit-messages/)
[articles](https://github.com/rcrowley/gitpaid) and I have checked out
some [products](http://letsfreckle.com/). I am going to use a new git
CLI based time tracking system.

Freshbooks has a decent api, so I should be able to integrate well with
this. I also use [assembla](https://www.assembla.com/) for many client
projects and github for others. Both assembla and github provide means
to call webhooks. Ideally I want to "build" a system using existing
components rather than building a new system from scratch.

Hustle and Flow
---------------

WIP, Comments welcome for ideal workflow git time tracking
because I am not quite sure the way I want to do this. I guess the time
tracking strategy would vary between workflow types.
