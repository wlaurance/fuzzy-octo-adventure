{"title":"Neutralizing Your Odds","date":"10-1-2012"}

The odds are against us. No matter how much I crunch the statistics the
casino games are not worth playing unless you are truly disciplined in
your betting habits.

In video roulette I started with twenty and would bet the minimum until
a payout occurred that put me above the original twenty. When this
became true I would cash my ticket. 

Giving the 00 wheel the odds black or red hit was 47% give or take some
1/10s. So theoretically over the long run I will lose 53% of the time.
Thus I wouldn't make money.

Or so I would think. The evil computers inside adjust the winnings to
keep the casino's win ratio at a specified percentage. This implies that
the ball lands on the position that will keep the casinos win/loss ratio
in check.

If we consider an always neutralizing win/loss ratio It would be best to
observe a game and wait for someone to lose a lot. Then proceed to put X
amount of dollars down on Red/Black, Odd/Even, 1-18/19-36 or any 1 to 1
or 2 to 1 odds bet. If this win/loss ratio was down the machine might be
more likely to pay out.

My best bet is to save up for a casino rather than spending my money at
one.
