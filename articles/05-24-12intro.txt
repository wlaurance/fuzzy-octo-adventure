My name is Will Laurance and I am a software developer. I have worked on
many interesting projects such as Mobile Ordering Apps, Rails apps like
http://www.osprey-watch.org and my old blog. I enjoy coding in all
languages, however my main focus is javascript and coffeescript.

Outside of coding, I enjoy riding dirt bikes, gardening, and reading
iteresting books.
