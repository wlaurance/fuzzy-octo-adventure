My name is Will Laurance and I am a software developer. I have worked on
many interesting projects such as Mobile Ordering Apps, Rails apps like
http://www.osprey-watch.org and my old blog. I enjoy coding in all
languages, however my main focus is javascript and coffeescript.
Outside of coding, I enjoy riding dirt bikes, gardening, and reading
interesting books. I also contribute to open source projects and create
node modules and other interesting things on github. [Fork me here](https://github.com/wlaurance)!
