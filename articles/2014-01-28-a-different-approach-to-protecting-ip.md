By building a product or business in the open, there exists a permanent
record of all the things that can be used to discredit copy cats.

Please discuss on hacker news.

I used to worry about intellectual property for everything I did.
In school, we read about the hard working men and women inventors from
the most recent industrial revolution that created wonderful medicines,
processes, gadgets, industries, and empires. More than likely, patents
were created for their ideas and protected someone from infringing on
their idea.

While protecting your ideas is still very important, I know longer think
that the patent mindset is the correct path as I was taught to believe
in my wonderful public education.

If you have an idea and make it to something real, there is a paper
trail, electronic or real paper, that shows hard evidence of your blood,
sweat and tears building an idea to a tangible item.

By being an open company, my ideas and the path to a product are
documented and timestamped. To be honest, all of this really hit me when
I watch the [OctoTales - Balanced](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukKd8W3Bvo0&feature=youtu.be)
segment and realized that if a very sensitive industry, $$ payments $$,
can be this open, there is no reason why
I/[dubsoft](http://www.dubsoft.net) cannot be open.

My first big venture into the open company world is a time tracker
for developers. It is located at [t3mp.us](http://www.t3mp.us) at the
moment and is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/t3mpus/tempus) under
the BSD 3-Clause License.

I am trying to solve a few different pain points that I
have encountered tracking time throughout my years.

Enough product plugging. My point is that the start of my idea and the
tangible work product are online, indexed, and easily found. My email
address, my name, my commits. While it may seem like a strange idea to
put yourself out in the open, this is the best way to protect yourself
and your ideas.
