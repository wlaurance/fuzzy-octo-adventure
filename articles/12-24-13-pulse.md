How do you tell if a person is alive?

**Check the pulse.**

How do you tell if a software company is alive?

**Check the pulse.**

We know what an animal pulse is, but what does it mean for a non living thing to have a pulse?

###What is a company pulse?

A **company pulse** is a vein or channel someone can listen in on to easily see the progress of a project or task.

The notion of a pulse implies that the channel is always sending message regardless if no one is listening.

In a healthy cardiovascular system, blood flows easily through arteries and veins. There is little resistance, build up, or friction.

The same should be true in a software company's flow. The project management tool should automatically send
emails when someone starts, finishes, changes, or comments on task/ticket/story. The SCM host should send 
messages when anyone pushes commits to any branches, makes a pull request, merges on a pull request, etc etc!

###Where to check the pulse?

There should be a master aggregator for the message channel. Be it email, IRC, campfire, hipchat, some in house chat server. Anything that can easily be a catch all funnel with an extremely low barrier of entry.

###Who can check the pulse?

Anyone in the organization should be able to check the pulse.
