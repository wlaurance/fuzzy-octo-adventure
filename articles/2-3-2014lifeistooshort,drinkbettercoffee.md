tl;dr

Drink better coffee in _ steps.

Low cost, high quality foods are awesome.

Coffee and beer are of this category. For less than $20 dollars per
unit, you can achieve the highest quality the human race has to offer.
(Of course there are some exceptions, ex coffee that does through the
[shitter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kopi_Luwak#Price_and_availability) can cost
a pretty penny)

Most of the [Trappist Beers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trappist_beer)
are relatively inexpensive and suburb quality. My favorite IPA, [Dogfish
Head 90 Minute IPA](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/64/2093/) is
one of the best in the world and I can get a 4 pack for 10 USD at my
local grocer. 

Wine on the other hand is very expensive to even come close to the "top"
shelf stuff. Just take a glance through this [list](http://www.wine-searcher.com/most-expensive-wines) and you can see it would be very expensive to drink one of these once a week.
Or even find these rare wines on a regular basis.

The price discrepancies are most likely explained by the rarity factor.
Wine tends to get better with age, while coffee and
beer have a very short window of maximum quality.

And when a short period of time is up, their value approaches nil.

##Back to the Coffee

1. Get the freshest coffee possible.

  With out fresh coffee, you are wasting your time with brewing
  techniques and high quality equipment.

  **Hands down** I recommend [BrewPony](http://brewpony.com/) to get fresh
  coffee. $30/mo gets you two awesome bags of coffee from a roaster in or
  near Portland, Oregon.

2. Use a burr grinder

  You want to **shave** the beans, not chop them. I bought this hand crank
  burr grinder off [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Hario-Coffee-Mill-Slim-Grinder/dp/B001804CLY/)

3. Use the correct grind for your apparatus

  Use this helpful chart below. You can even [purchase it](http://popchartlab.com/collections/prints/products/the-compendious-coffee-chart)
  if you like.

4. Use a good apparatus

  My personal favorite is the [chemex](http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/).
  It does not get much better than the chemex experience.

5. Use the correct water temperature 

  Generally, 200F or 93C is the perfect temperature. Invest in a good
  electric like the [Bonavita 1-Liter](http://www.amazon.com/Bonavita-Variable-Temperature-Electric-Gooseneck/dp/B005YR0F40/).

Out of all these steps, 1. is the most important. But once you have the
best coffee beans possible, steps 2 through 5 become very important!
