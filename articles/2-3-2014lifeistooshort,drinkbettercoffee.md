Drink better coffee in 5 steps.

Low cost, high quality foods are awesome.

Coffee and beer are of this category. For less than $20 dollars per
unit, you can achieve the highest quality the human race has to offer.
(Of course there are some exceptions, ex coffee that goes through the
[shitter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kopi_Luwak#Price_and_availability) can cost
a pretty penny)

When I explain my coffee snob point of view, these are the 5 topics I cover.

###1. Get the freshest coffee possible

  With out fresh coffee, you are wasting your time with brewing
  techniques and high quality equipment.

  **Hands down** I recommend [BrewPony](http://brewpony.com/) for fresh
  coffee. $30/mo gets you two awesome bags of coffee from a roaster in or
  near Portland, Oregon delivered to your mailbox less than a week after
  roasting.

###2. Use a burr grinder

  You want to **shave** the beans, not chop them. I bought this hand crank
  burr grinder from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Hario-Coffee-Mill-Slim-Grinder/dp/B001804CLY/).

###3. Use the correct grind for your apparatus

  Use this helpful chart below. You can even [purchase it](http://popchartlab.com/collections/prints/products/the-compendious-coffee-chart)
  if you like.

###4. Use a good apparatus

  My personal favorite is the [chemex](http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/).
  It does not get much better than the chemex experience.

###5. Use the correct water temperature 

  Generally, 200F or 93C is the perfect temperature. Invest in a good
  electric like the [Bonavita 1-Liter](http://www.amazon.com/Bonavita-Variable-Temperature-Electric-Gooseneck/dp/B005YR0F40/).

Out of all these steps, 1. is the most important. But once you have the
best coffee beans possible, steps 2 through 5 become very important!
